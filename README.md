# Section 3

### In this section, it was necessary to analyze the dataset and implement some coding with further interpretations/observations of some results
####
## 📝 _Algorithm_
###### For each row of data, the "find_peaks" function is called, which finds peaks (maxima) in the data exceeding the specified threshold "height_threshold. find_peaks" returns the indexes of the peaks found and their properties, such as height (properties).

###### If peaks are found in a row (that is, the length of peaks is greater than zero), a tuple is added to the "lines" list containing: The index of the row, the Indexes of the peaks found, the Heights of the peaks.

###### The function returns a list of "lines" containing information about the found lines (peaks) for all data rows.
